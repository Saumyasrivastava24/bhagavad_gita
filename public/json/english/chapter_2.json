Though you speak words of wisdom? you are unwise because you grieve for those who are really eternal and who deserve no grief. They who are endowed with the knowledge of the Self are wise men. They will not grieve for the living or for the dead because they know well that the Self is immortal and that It is unborn. They also know that there is no such a thing as death?that it is a separation of the astral body from the physical? that death is nothing more than a disintegration of matter and that the five elements of which the body is composed return to their source. Arjuna had forgotten the eternal nature of the Soul and the changing nature of the body. Because of his ignorance? he began to act as if the temporary relations with kinsmen? teachers? etc.? were permanent.He forgot that his relations with this world in his present life were the results of past actions.

The more you are able to identify yourself with the immortal? allpervading Self? the less willyou be affected by the pairs of opposites (Dvandvas? pleasure and pain? etc.)Titiksha or the power of endurance develops the willpower. Calm endurance in pleasure and pain? and heat and cold is one of the alifications of an aspirant on the path of Jnana Yoga. It is one of the Shatsampat or sixfold virtues. It is a condition of right knowledge. Titiksha by itself cannot give you Moksha or liberation?but still? when coupled with discrimination and dispassion? it becomes a means to the attainment of Immortality or knowledge of the Self.

The followers of this school deal with rituals and prescribe many of them for attaining enjoyments and power here and happiness in heaven. They regardthis as the ultimate object of human existence. Ordinary people are attracted by their panegyrics.
