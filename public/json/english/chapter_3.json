Those who have a tendency or inclination for wok are fit for Karma Yoga. (The four means are discrimination? dispassion? sixfold virutes? and longing forliberation. The sixfold virtues are control of the mind? control of the senses? fortitude (endurance)? turning away from the objects of the world? faith and tranillity.)It is not possible for a man to practise the two Yogas simultaneously. Karma Yoga is a means to an end. It purifies the heart and prepares the aspirant for the reception of knowledge. The Karma Yogi should take up Jnana Yoga as soon as his heart is purified. Jnana Yoga takes the aspirant directly to the goal without any extraneous help. (Cf.V.5).",

If a man simply sits iet by abandoning action you cannot say that he has attained to the state of actionlessness. His mind will be planning? schemingand speculating. Thought is real action.

Rajasic and Tamasic actions bind a man to Samsara.These alities cannot affect a man who has knowledge of the Self. He has crossed over these alities. He has become a Gunatita (one who has transcended the alities of Nature). The ignorant man who has no knowledge of the Self and who is swayed by Avidya or nescience is driven helplessly to action by the Gunas. (Cf.IV.16?XVIII.11).",

      "translation": "Thus, knowing Him who is superior to the intellect and restraining the self by the Self, slay thou, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the enemy in the form of desire, hard to conquer.",
      "commentary": "3.43 एवम् thus? बुद्धेः than the intellect? परम् superior? बुद्ध्वा having known? संस्तभ्य restraining? आत्मानम् the self? आत्मना by the Self? जहि slay thou? शत्रुम् the enemy? महाबाहो O mightyarmed? कामरूपम् of the form of desire? दुरासदम् hard to coner.Commentary Restrain the lower self by the higher Self. Subdue the lower mind by the higher mind. It is difficult to coner desire because it is ofa highly complex and incomprehensible nature. But a man of discrimination and dispassion who does constant and intense Sadhana can coner it ite easily. Desire is the ality of Rajas. If you increase the Sattvic ality in you? you can coner desire. Rajas cannot stand before Sattva.Even though desire is hard to coner? it is not impossible. The simple and direct method is to appeal to the Indwelling Presence(God) through prayer and Japa.Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita? the science of the Eternal? the scripture of Yoga? the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna? ends the third discourse entitledThe Yoga of Action.",
      "pronunciation": "evaṁ buddheḥ paraṁ buddhvā sanstabhyātmānam ātmanā\njahi śhatruṁ mahā-bāho kāma-rūpaṁ durāsadam"
