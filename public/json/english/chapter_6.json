He who has renounced the daily rituals like Agnihotra? which are performed with the help of fire.Akriya without action. He who has renounced austerities and other meritorious acts like building resthouses? charitable dispensaries? digging wells? feeding the poor? etc.Sannyasi he who has renounced the fruits of his actions.Yogi he who hasa steady mind. These two terms are applied to him in a secondary sense only. They are not used to denote that he is in reality a Sannyasi and a Yogi.The Sannyasi performs neither Agnihotra nor other ceremonies. But simply to omit these without genuine renunciation will not make one a real Sannyasi. (Cf.V.3)",

No one can become aKarma Yogi who plans and schemes and expects fruits for his actions. No devotee of action who has not renounced the thought of the fruits of his actions can become a Yogi of steady mind. The thought of the fruits will certainly make the mind unsteady.Lord Krishna eulogises Karma Yoga here because it is the means or an external aid (Bahiranga Sadhana) to Dhyana Yoga. Karma Yoga is a steppingstone toDhyana Yoga. It leads to the Yoga of Meditation in due course. In order to encourage the practice of Karna Yoga it is stated here that Karma Yoga is Sannyasa.

Sama or renunciation of actions is said to be the means.The more perfectly he abstains from actions? the more steady his mind is? and the more peaceful,he is? the more easily and thoroughly does his mindget fixed in the Self.

Cf. notes to V.13)? knowing that they are of no use to him when he has renounced all thoughts which generate various sorts of desires for the objects of this world and of the next? then he is said to have become a Yogarudha.Do not think of senseobjects. The desires will die by themselves. How can you free yourself from thinking of theobjects Think of God or the Self. Then you can avoid thinking of the objects. Then you can free yourself from thinking of the objects of the senses.Renunciation of thoughts implies that all desires and all actions should be renounced? because all desires are born of thoughts. You think first and then act (strive) afterwards to possess the objects of your desire for enjoyment.Whatever a man desires?that he willsAnd whatever he wills? that he does. -- Brihadaranyaka Upanishad? 4.4.5Renunciation of all actions necessarily follows from the renunciation of all desires.O desire I know where thy root lies. Thou art born of Sankalpa (thought). I will not think of thee and thou shalt cease to exist along with the root. -- Mahabharata?

Do not become a wordlyminded man. Do not become a slave of lust? greed and anger. Rise above worldliness? become divine and attain Godhead.You alone are your friend you alone are your enemy. The socalled worldly friend is not your real friend? because he gets attached to you? wastes your time and puts obstacles on your path of Yoga. He is veryselfish and keeps friendship with you only to extract something. If he is not able to get from you the object of his selfish interest? he forsakes you. Therefore he is your enemy in reality. If you are attached to your friend on account of delusion or affection? this will become a cause of your bondage to Samsara.Friends and enemies are not outside. They exist in the mind only. It is the mind thatmakes a friend an enemy and an enemy a friend. Therefore the Self alone is the friend of oneself? and the Self alone is the enemy of oneself.

He should renounce allpossessions.A householder with Yogic tendencies and spiritual inclination? can practise meditation in a solitary and iet room in his own house or any solitary place on the banks of any holy river (during the holidays or throughout the year if he is a wholetime aspirant or if he has retired from service).The practice must be constant. Only then can one attain Selfrealisation surely and ickly. He whopractises meditation by fits and starts and for a few minutes daily will not be able to achieve any tangible results in Yoga. The Yogic aspirant should be free from hope? desire and greed. Only then will he have a steady mind. Hope? desire and greed make the mind ever restless and turbulent. They are the enemies of peace and Selfknowledge. The aspirant should not have many possessions either. He canonly keep those articles which are absolutely necessary for the maintenance of his body. If there are many possessions? the mind will be ever thinking of them and attempting to protect them.It you are well established in the practice of Pratyahara? Sama and Dama (withdrawal of the senses? control of mind and the body respectively)? if you have the senses under your full control? you can find perfectsolitude and peace even in the most crowded and noisy place of a big city. If the senses are turbulent? if you have not got the power to withdraw them? you will have no peace of mind even in a solitary cave of the Himalayas. A disciplined Yogi who has controlled the senses and the mind can enjoy peace of mind in a solitary cave. A passionate man who has not controlled the senses and the mind willonly be building castles in the air if he lives in a solitary cave in a mountain.He who has reduced his wants? who has not a bit of attraction for the world? who has,discrimination and burning aspiration for liberation? and who has observed Mauna (the vow of silence) for months together will be able to live in a cave.You should have perfect control over the body through the regular practice of YogaAsanas before you take to serious and constant meditation.Aparigraha means noncovetousness? freedom from possessions.The spiritual aspirant need not bother himself about his bodily needs. Everything is provided by God. Everything is prearranged by Mother Nature. She looks after the bodily needs of all very carefully in a more efficient manner than they themselves would do. She knows beter what thereirements are and provides them then and there. Understand the mysterious ways of Mother Nature and become wise. Be grateful to Her for Her unie kindness? grace and mercy.If you want to retire into solitue for the practice of meditation? and if you are a householder with a thirst for intense spiritual Sadhana? you cannot all of a sudden sever your connection with your family. Sudden severance ofworldly ties may produce intense mental agony in you and shock in them. You will have to break the ties gradually. Stay for a week or a month in seclusion to begin with. Then gradually prolong the period. They will not feel the pangs of separation from you.As your will has become very weak? as you had no religious discipline or training in schools and colleges when you were young? and as you are underthe sway of materialistic influences? it is necessary for you to go in for seclusion for some days or weeks (during the Chritstmas? Easter or other holidays) to practise rigorous Japa and meditation and to develop your willpower.Those who have fixed up their sons in life and who have retired from service? and who have discharged their duties as householders can remain in seclusion for four or fiveyears and practise intense meditation and Tapas (penance) for selfpurification and Selfrealisation. This is like entering a university for higher studies or postgraduate course of study. When the Tapas is over? and when they have attained to Selfknowledge? they should come out and share their knowledge of the Self with others through lectures? conversations? discourses or hearttoheart talks accordingto their capacity and disposition.How can sensecontrol be tested in a lonely forest where there are no temptations The Yogic student living in a cave should test himself after he has sufficiently advanced? by coming into the society of people. But he should not test himself every now and then like the man who removed the young plant daily after watering it to see whether it had struck deep root or not.",

The real Supreme Self is the Atma. This is Primary (Mukhya). Mind also is the self.But this is used in a secondary sense (Gauna). Mukhya Atma is Brahman or the highest Self. Gauna Atma is the mind.Make the mind onepointed by collecting all its dissipated rays by the practice of Yoga. Withdraw it from all senseobjects again and again and try to fix it steadily on your Lakshya or point of meditation or centre. Gradually you will have concentration of the mind or onepointedness. Youmust be very regular in your practice. Only then will you succeed. Regularity is of paramount importance. You should know the ways and habits of the mind through daily introspection? selfanalysis or selfexamination. You should have a knowledge of the laws of the mind. Then it will be easy for you to check the wandering mind. When you sit for meditation? and when you deliberately attempt to forgetthe worldly objects? all sorts of worldly thoughts will crop up in your mind and disturb your meditation. You will be ite astonished. Old thoughts that you entertained several years ago? and old memories of past enjoyments will bubble up and force the mind to wander in all directions. You will find that the trapdoor of the vast subconscious mind is opened or the lid of the storehouse of thoughts withinis lifted up and the thoughts gush out in a continous stream. The more you attempt to still them? the more they will bubble up with redoubled force and strength.Be not discouraged. Nil desperandum. Never despair. Through regular and constant meditation you can purify the subconscious mind and its constant memories. The fire of meditation will burn all thoughts. Be sure of this. Meditation is a potentantidote to annihilate the poisonous worldly thoughts. Be assured of this.Meditation on the immortal Self will act like a dynamite and blow up all thoughts and memories in the conscious mind. If the thoughts trouble you much? do not try to suppress them by force. Be a silent witness as in a bioscope. They will subside gradually. Then try to root them out through regual silent meditation.During introspectionyou can clearly observe the rapid shifting of the mind from one line of thought to another. Herein lies a chance for you to mould the mind properly and direct the thoughts and the mental energy in the divine channel. You can rearrange the thoughts and make new associations on a new Sattvic basis. You can throw out wordly and useless thoughts. Just as you remove the weeds and throw them out? you canthrow these out? and you can cultivate sublime? divine thoughts in the divine garden of your mind. This is a very patient work. This is a stupendous task indeed. But for a Yogi of determination who has the grace of the Lord and an iron will it is nothing.Calm the bubbling emotions? sentiments? instincts and impulses gradually through silent meditation. You can give a new orientation to your feelingsby gradual and systematic practice. You can entirely transmute your wordly nature into divine nature. You can exercise supreme control over the nervecurrents? muscles? the five sheaths (of the Self)? emotions? impulses and instincts through meditation.",

If the body is unsteady? the mind will also becomeunsteady. There is an intimate connection between the body and the mind.You should not shake the body even a bit. You should attain mastery over the Asana (AsanaJaya) by daily practice. You should be as firm as a statue or a rock. If you keep the body? head and neck erect? the spinal cord also will be erect and the Kundalini will rise up steadily through the subtle nervechannel (Nadi) called the Sushumna.Sit in the lotus pose or the adept pose. This will help you in maintaining the nervous eilibrium and mental poise. You should steadily direct your gaze towards the tip of your nose. This is known as the Nasikagra Drishti. The other gaze is the Bhrumadhya Drishti or gazing between the two eyrows where the psychic centre known as the Ajna Chakra is situated. This is described in chapter V? verse 27.In Bhrumadhya Drishti direct the gaze towards the Ajna Chakra with closed eyes. If you practise this with open eyes? it may produce headache. Foreign particles or dust may fall into the eyes. There may be distraction of the mind also. Do not strain the eyes. Practise gently. When you practise concentration at the tip of the nose you will experience DivyaGandha (various aromas). When you concentrateyour gaze at the Ajna Chakra you will experience DivyaJyotis (perception of supraphenomenal lights). This is an experience to give you encouragement? push you up in the spiritual path and convince you of the existence of transcendental or supraphysical things. Do not stop your Sadhana. Yogins and those Bhaktas who meditate on Lord Siva concentrate on the Ajna Chakra with the Bhrumadhya Drishti. Youcan select whichever Drishti suits you best.Though the gaze is directed towards the tip of the nose when the eyes are halfclosed and the eyalls are steady the mind should be fixed only on the self. Therefore you will have to gaze? as it were? at the tip of the nose. In chapter VI? verse 25? the Lord says Having made the mind abide in the Self? let him not think of anything. Gazing at the tip of thenose will soon bring about concentration of the mind.Whichever be the point selected? visualise your own tutelary deity there and feel His Living Presence.",

The Divine Light can descend only in a serene mind. Serenity is attained by the eradication ofVasanas or desires and cravings. He should be fearless. This is the most important alification. A timid man or a coward is very far from Selfrealisation.A Brahmachari (celibate) should serve his Guru or the spiritual preceptor wholeheartedly and should live on alms. This also constitutes the BrahmachariVrata. The aspirant should control the modifications of the mind. He should be balanced in pleasureand pain? heat and cold? honour and dishonour. He should ever think of the Lord and take Him as the Supreme Goal.Brahmacharya also means continence. Semen or the vital fluid tones the nerves and the brain? and energises the whole system. That Brahmachari who has preserved this vital force by the vow,of celibacy and sublimated it into Ojas Sakti or radiant spiritual power can practise steady meditationfor a long period. Only he can ascend the ladder of Yoga. Without Brahmacharya or celibacy not an iota or spiritual progress is possible. Continence is the very foundation on which the superstructure of meditation and Samadhi can be built up. Many persons waste this vital energy -- a great spiritual treasure indeed -- when they become blind and lose their power of reason under sexual excitement. Pitiable is their lot They cannot make substantial progress in Yoga.",
