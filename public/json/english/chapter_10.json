As He is the source of the gods and the great sages? there is no source for His existence.As He is beginningless He is unborn. He is the great Lord of all the worlds.Asammudhah Undeluded. He who has realised that his own innermost Self is not different from the Supreme Self is an undeluded person. Through the removal of ignorance the delusion which is of the form of mutual superimposition between the Self and the notSelf is also removed. He is freed from all sins done consciously or unconsciouslyin the three periods of time.The ignorant man removes his sins through the performance of expiatory acts (Prayaschitta) and enjoyment of the results. But he is not completely freed from all sins because he continues to do sinful actions through the force of evil Samskaras or impressions because he has not eradicated ignorance? the root cause of all sins? and its effect? egoism and superimpositionor the feeling of I in the physical body. As he dies? swayed by the forces of evil Samskaras? he engages himself in doing sinful actions in the next birth. But the sage of Selfrealisation is completely liberated from,all sins because ignorance? the root cause of all sins? and its effect? viz.? the mistaken notion that the body is the Self on account of mutual superimposition between the Self and thenotSelf? is eradicated in toto along with the Samskaras and all the sins. The Samskaras are burnt completely like roasted seeds. Just as burnt seeds cannot germinate? so also the burnt Samskaras cannot generate further actions or future births.For the following reason also? I am the great Lord of the worlds.",

Commentary Intellect is the power which the Antahkarana (the fourfold inner instrument -- the mind? the subconscious mind? intellect and egoism)has of understanding subtle objects.

Patience is the nonagitation of the mind when assaulted or abused. Not thinking of any harm of evil for those who ahve assulted or abused is also patience. Patience is enduring without lamentation thethree kinds of pains? Adhyatmika? Adhidaivika and Adhibhautika Taapas. Fever? etc.? is Adhyatmika pain.

Pain from scorpionsting? snakite? and wild animals is Adhibhautika pain.Satyam or truth is veracity. It is speaking of ones own actual or real experience of things as actually heard or seen. Thereis not the least twisting or exaggeration or the slightest modification of facts. Dama or selfrestraint is control of the external senses. It is withdrawal of the senses (ear? skin? eyes? tongue and nose) from their respective objects (viz.? sound? touch? form? palatable foods and fragrance). Sama is calmness or tranillity of the mind produced by checking the mind from thinking of external objectsof the senses and by disconnecting it from the senses.Sukham Happiness.

Commentary Ahimsa is noninjury to living beings in thought? word and deed. Samata is that state wherein there is neither Raga (like) nor Dvesha (dislike)? when one gets pleasantor unpleasant objects. There is neither exhilaration when one gets pleasant or favourable objects nor depressions when one gets unpleasant or unfavourable objects. Tushtih is satisfaction or contentment. The man of contentment is satisfied with whatever object he gets through Prarabdha. He is satisfied with his present acisitions. He is free from greed and so he has peace of mind. Contentment makesa man very rich. It annihilates greed. Greed makes even a rich man a beggar of beggars. A greedy man is ever restless. Tapas is restraint of the senses? with bodily mortification through the practice of fasting and slow reduction of food. The strength of the body and the senses is reduced through fasting.Danam is beneficence. It is sharing of ones own things with others according to ones own means?or distribution of rice? gold? cloth? etc.? to a worthy person? in a fit place and time? especially to one who can do nothign in return.Yasas is fame due to Dharma or virtuous actions.Ayasah is illfame or disgrace due to Adharma or sinful actions.All these different kinds of alities of living beings arise from Me alone? the great Lord of the worlds? according to their respective Karmas.",

Commentary In the beginning I was alone and from Me came the mind and from the mind were produced the seven sages (such as Bhrigu? Vasishtha and others)? the ancient four Kumaras(Sanaka? Sanandana? Sanatkumara and Sanatsujata)? as well as the four Manus of the past ages known as Savarnis? all of whom directed their thoughts to Me exclusively and were therefore endowed with divine powers and supreme wisdom.The four Kumaras (chaste? ascetic youths) declined to marry and create offspring. They preferred to remain perpetual celibates and to practise BrahmaVichara or profoundmeditation on Brahman or the Absolute.They were all created by Me? by mind alone. They were all mindborn sons of Brahma. They were not born from the womb like ordinary mortals. Manavah? men? the present inhabitants of this world? are the sons of Manu. The Manus are the mindborn sons of God. These creatures which consist of the moving and the unmoving beings are born of the seven great sages and thefour Manus. The great sages were original teaches of BrahmaVidya or the ancient wisdom of the Upanishads. The Manus were the rulers of men. They framed the code or rules of conduct or the laws of Dharma for the guidance and uplift of humanity.The seven great sages represent the seven planes also. In the macrocosm? Mahat or cosmic Buddhi? Ahamkara or the cosmic egoism and the five Tanmatras or thefive rootelements of which the five great elements? viz.? earth? water? fire? air and ether are the gross forms? represent the seven great sages. This gross universe with the moving and the unmoving beings and the subtle inner world have come out of the above seven principles. In mythology or the Puranic terminology these seven principles have been symbolised and give human names. Bhrigu? Marichi?Atri? Pulastya? Pulaha? Kratu and Vasishtha are the seven great sages.In the microcosm? Manas (mind)? Buddhi (intellect)? Chitta (subconsciousness) and Ahamkara (egoism) have been symbolised as the four Manus and given human names. The first group forms the base of the macrocosm. The second group forms the base of the microcosm (individuals). These two groups constitute this vast universe of sentient life.Madbhava with their being in Me? of My nature.",

      "commentary": "10.7 एताम् this? विभूतिम् (manifold) manifestation of My Being? Commentary Knowledge of the glory of the Lord is really conducive to Yoga. He who knows in essence the immanent pervading power of the Lord by which He causes the manifestations? and His diverse manifestations (Vibhutis)? unites with Him in firm unalterable Yoga and attains eternal bliss and perfect harmony. From the ant to the Creatorthere is nothing except the Lord. He who knows in reality this extensive manifestation of the Lord and His Yoga (Yoga here stands for what is born of Yoga? viz.? infinite Yogic powers as well as omniscience)? is endowed with firm unwavering Yoga. He lives in the Eternal and is endowed with the highest knowledge of the Self. He who has realised this Truth is free from the superiority and inferioritycomplexes. There i real awakening of wisdom in him. He will behold the Lord in all beings and all beings in the Lord. He will never hate any creature on this earth. This is a rare living cosmic experience. The Yogi realises that the Lord and His manifestations are one. He attains the supreme goal and is absorbed in Him through his wholehearted devotion. He is perfectly aware of his oneness with theSupreme by My divine Yoga.He can keep his balance of mind now in whatever environments and circumstances he is placed and can do any action without losing his consciousness of oneness or identity with the Supreme Self.

Commentary Waves originate in water? depend on water and dissolve in water. The only support for the waves is water. Even so the only support for the whole world is the Lord. Realising this?feeling the omnipresence of the Lord? the wise worship Him with devotion and affection in all places. The Supreme is the same in all countries and at all times. He is the material and the efficient cause.As Mulaprakriti or Avyaktam the Lord is the source of all forms. The Lord is the primum mobile. He gazes at His Sakti (creative power) and the whole world evolves and the forms move. The worldly manwho has neither sharp nor subtle intellect beholds the changing forms only through the fleshly eyes. He has no idea of the Indwelling Presence? the substratum? the allpervading intelligence or the blissful consciousness. He is allured by the passing forms. He fixes his hopes and joy on these transitory forms. He lives and exerts for them. He rejoices when he gets a wife and children. If these formspass away he is drowned in sorrow. But the wise ones constantly dwell in the Supreme? the source and the life of all? and enjoy the eternal bliss of the immortal? inner Self? their own nondual Atman? albeit all these forms around them change and pass away. They are steadfast in Yoga. They are endowed with unshakable Yoga. They are enthroned in Yoga. They worship the Supreme in contemplation and enjoythe indescribable bliss of Nirvikalpa Samadhi.Para Brahman? known as Vaasudeva? is the source of the whole world. From Him alone evolves the whole world with all its changes? viz.? existence (Sthiti)? destruction (Nasa)? action (Kriya)? fruit (Phala) and enjoyment (Bhoga).

The devotee constantly thinksof the Lord. His very life is absorbed in Him. He has consecrated his whole life to the Lord. According to another interpretation? all his senses (which function because of the Prana)? such as the eye are absorbed in Him. He takes immense delight in talking about Him? about His supreme wisdom? power? might and other attributes. He has completely dedicated himself to the Lord.He feels intense satisfactionand is delighted as if he is in the company of his Beloved (God). The Purana says?

One part of Myself constitutes all beings.All beings form His foot (Taittiriya Aranyaka 3.12). The whole world is one Pada or foot of the Lord.

Lord Krishna prepares Arjuna for this grand vision by giving him a description of His glories.Arjuna says O Lord? I now realise that the whole world is filled by Thee. I now wish to behold the wholeuniverse in Thee with my eye of intuition.Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita? the science of the Eternal? the scripture of Yoga? the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna? ends the tenth discourse entitledThe Yoga of the Divine Glories.,",
