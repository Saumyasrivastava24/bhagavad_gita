Arjuna has an intense longing to have the wonderful vision of the Cosmic Form with his own eyes. His bewilderment and delusionhave now vanished.Adhyatma That which treats of the discrimination between the Self and the notSelf metaphysics.I was worried about the sin involved in killing my relations and preceptors. I had the ideas? I am the agent in killing them they are to be killed by me.This delusion has vanished now after receiving Thy most profound and valuable instructions. Thou hast dispelled this delusion of ignorancefrom me.The vision of the Cosmic Form is not the ultimate goal. If that were so? the Gita would have ended with this chapter. The vision of the Cosmic Form is also one more in a series of graded experiences. It is a terrible experience too. That is the reason why Arjuna said to the Lord? stammering with fear What an awful form Thou hast I have seen that which none hath seen before. My heart is glad?yet faileth me on account of fear. Show me? O God? Thine other form again. O God of gods? support of all the worlds? let me see Thy form with the diadem? and with the mace and discus in Thy hands. Again I wish to see Thee as before assume Thy fourarmed form? O Lord of thousand arms and of forms innumerable.Arjuna heard the Lords statement? viz.? Having pervaded this whole universe with one fragmentof Myself? I remain. This induced him to have the vision of the Lords Cosmic Form. He says? O Lord of compassion? Thou hast taught me the spiritual wisdom which can hardly be found in the Vedas. Thou hast saved me. My delusion has disappeared. Thou hast disclosed to me the nature of the Supreme Self? the secrets of Nature and Thy divine glories. My greatest ambition at the present moment is that I should behold with my own eyes Thy entire Cosmic Form.",

He who practises this teaching will attain Supreme Bliss and Immortality. This versecontains the summary of the entire philosophy of the Gita.He who performs actions (duties) for the sake of the Lord? who consecrates all his actions to Him? who serves the Lord with his heart and soul? who regards the Lord as his supreme goal? who lives for Him alone? who works for Him alone? who sees the Lord in everything? who sees the whole world as the Cosmic Form of the Lord and therefore cherishesno feeling of hatred or enmity towards any creature even when great injury has been done by others to him? who has no attachment or love to wealth? children? wife? friends and relatives? and who seeks nothing else but the Lord? realises Him and enters into His Being. He becomes one with Him.Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita? the science of the Eternal? the scripture of Yoga? the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna? ends the eleventh discourse entitledThe Yoga of the Vision of the Cosmic Form.,",
